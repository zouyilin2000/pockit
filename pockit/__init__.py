"""# pockit: Python Optimal Control KIT

**ðŸ˜ƒ Welcome to pockit's API documentation!**

**Pockit** is a Python package for solving optimal control problems numerically. It combines advanced techniques to deliver a powerful, user-friendly, and fast solution.

- ðŸ’ª **Powerful:** Pockit is designed to solve multi-phase optimal control problems with support for path, algebraic, and boundary condition constraints.
- ðŸ”¢ **User-friendly:** Pockit features a [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/)-based interface that makes defining and solving problems intuitive.
- âš¡ **Fast:** Pockit achieves high performance through symbolic differentiation (with [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/)), Just-In-Time compilation (with [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/)), vectorization, and other advanced techniques.

Please visit the [project page](https://github.com/zouyilin2000/pockit) and the [documentation](https://pockit.pages.dev) for more information.
