"""# pockit: Python Optimal Control KIT

**ðŸ˜ƒ Welcome to pockit's API documentation!**

**Pockit** is a Python package that solves optimal control problems numerically. It utilizes advanced techniques to be powerful, easy to use, and fast.

- ðŸ’ª **Powerful:** Pockit can handle basically any optimal problem. It employs a multiple-phase optimal control model that allows continuous/non-continuous state and control variables, path/integral/boundary constraints, and fixed/free initial and terminal time.
- ðŸ”¢ **Easy to use:** Pockit is designed to be easy to use. It provides a [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/)-based, intuitive interface for defining and solving problems.
- âš¡ **Fast:** Pockit is fast. It uses various techniques to speed up the entire compilation and solution process, including symbolic differentiation (with [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/)), Just-In-Time compilation (with [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/)), vectorization, and more.
