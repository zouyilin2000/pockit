# pockit: Python Optimal Control KIT

**ðŸ˜ƒ Welcome to pockit's project page**

## Introduction

**Pockit** is a Python package that solves optimal control problems numerically. It utilizes advanced techniques to be powerful, easy to use, and fast.

- ðŸ’ª **Powerful:** Pockit can handle almost any optimal control problem. It employs a multiple-phase optimal control model that allows for continuous/non-continuous state and control variables, path/integral/boundary constraints, and fixed/free initial and terminal times.
- ðŸ”¢ **Easy to use:** Pockit is designed to be user-friendly. It provides a [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/)-based, intuitive interface for defining and solving problems.
- âš¡ **Fast:** Pockit is fast. It uses various techniques to speed up the entire compilation and solution process, including symbolic differentiation (with [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/)), Just-In-Time compilation (with [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/)), vectorization, and more.

## LQR in 1 Minute
```python
from pockit.lobatto import System, constant_guess
from pockit.optimizer import ipopt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# LQR problem:
# min âˆ«_0^1 (q * x^2 + r * u^2) dt + s * x_f^2 / 2
# s.t. x' = a * x + b * u, x(0) = 1

# Set parameters
a, b, s, q, r = -1, 1, 1, 1, 0.1

# Set up the system
# The system has one free parameter x_f
system = System(["x_f"])
x_f, = system.s  # extract the Sympy symbol x_f
# The phase has one state x and one control u
phase = system.new_phase(["x"], ["u"])
x, = phase.x  # extract the Sympy symbol x
u, = phase.u  # extract the Sympy symbol u
phase.set_dynamics([a * x + b * u])  # x' = a * x + b * u
# I = âˆ« q * x^2 + r * u^2 dt
phase.set_integral([q * x ** 2 + r * u ** 2])
# x(0) = 1, x(t_f) = x_f, t_0 = 0, t_f = 1
phase.set_boundary_condition([1], [x_f], 0, 1)
# 10 subintervals with 10 collocation points in each subinterval
phase.set_discretization(10, 10)
system.set_phase([phase])  # bind the phase to the system
# define the objective function
system.set_objective(phase.I[0] + s * x_f ** 2 / 2)

# initial guess for the phase
guess = constant_guess(phase, 0)
# 0. is the initial guess for the free parameter x_f
# var_p: the optimal solution for the phase
# var_s: the optimal solution for the free parameter
[var_p, var_s], info = ipopt.solve(system, [guess, [0.]])

# Print the results
print("status:", info["status_msg"].decode())
print("objective:", info["obj_val"])  # 0.2319139744522318

# Plot the results
# only one state variable and one control variable, 
# so the indices are 0 for both
plt.plot(var_p.t_x, var_p.x[0], label="x")
plt.plot(var_p.t_u, var_p.u[0], label="u")
plt.legend()
plt.minorticks_on()
plt.grid(linestyle='--')
plt.show()
```
